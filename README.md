# Helloworld-with-spring MVC
so in this repository i have made three different file using springboot framwork to explain this hello  world application. through this u can understand the difference b/w servlets(Servlets have HTML code within Java code.),jsp(JSP has Java code within HTML code.)and mvc architecture that how we can create any real time application by using this and which is better and best to go ahead with.

#Servlet vs JSP
so JSP is a better way of creating dynamic websites. Using JSP as the technology to build a web application, work can be separated between a person responsible for developing the HTML code, or the front-end, and the person developing the dynamic components, or the back-end. That is, it decouples the implementation of the presentation logic (HTML code) and the business logic (Java code), which makes the web application more robust and easier to maintain.

#One of the major drawbacks of developing a web application using servlet/JSP is the separation of concerns. MVC or the Model-View-Controller aims to solve exactly this problem. It separates an application into components called model, view, and controller:

Model: This represents the data layer of the application. 
View: This is the presentation layer of the application.
Controller: This is the business logic of the application.

so now u must we clear that MVC is the best for our web application.
